Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with GoJS):

HTML Structure: Create an HTML page where users can register their name and view their assigned teams, along with real-time data such as team scores and stadium information.
CSS Styling: Style the HTML elements for a visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript for User Interaction:
Implement user registration form with input fields like name, email, etc.
Use JavaScript to handle form submission and send registration data to the backend server.
Display the list of registered users and their assigned teams, along with real-time data fetched from APIs for team scores, stadium information, etc. Use GoJS for visualization if needed.

Backend (Go or any other backend language):

Server Setup: Set up a backend server using Go or any other language/framework of your choice. Done 
Database Integration: Connect your backend server to an SQL database to store user registration data and team assignments.
API Integration:
Integrate APIs for fetching real-time data such as team scores, stadium information, etc.
Implement logic to fetch and process data from these APIs as needed to display on the frontend.
Store necessary API keys securely and handle API requests securely from the backend.
User Registration and Team Assignment Logic:
Implement endpoints for user registration and team assignment.
Upon user registration, randomly assign/pair the user with a team and store this information in the database.
Ensure that multiple users can be assigned to the same team if required.
Database Design (SQL):

Tables: Design SQL tables to store user information and team assignments.
User Table: Include fields like user ID, name, email, etc.
Team Assignment Table: Include fields like user ID and team ID to track which user is assigned to which team.
